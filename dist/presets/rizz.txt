Do you have a name, or can I call you mine?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
If beauty were a crime, you'd definitely be serving life.
Are you Wi‑Fi? Because I'm feeling a strong connection.
Do you have a map? Because I just got lost in your eyes.
You must be a campfire, because you're hot and I want s'more.
Even my GPU doesn't render something this stunning.
Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're Cu‑Te.
Are you a keyboard? Because you're just my type.
You're so sweet, you could put Hershey's out of business.
You must be a time traveler — because I see you in my future.
Is your name Google? Because you have everything I've been searching for.
Are we in a server together? Because I feel a special connection here.
If we were both strings, I'd be tied to you forever.
